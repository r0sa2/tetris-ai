## About
This repository is intended to document the implementation of a deep RL agent to 
play Tetris.

The game is played on a standard 20x10 grid, with a shuffled bag of size 7 used 
to generate the tetrominoes (https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Random_Generator).

## Status
This project is still a work-in-progress.
